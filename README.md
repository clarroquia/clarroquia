# Hi, Iâ€™m Carmen ðŸ‘‹

## **Full Stack Developer based in Utrecht.**

With my background as an Architect spanning 15 years,
I bring a comprehensive understanding of different project stages
which I apply to write clear and straightforward code. 

Between January - July 2024 I followed the Web Dev bootcamp at Le Wagon,
a part-time full-stack course that teaches the skills relevant for practice.
It focuses on pair programming and team work to ensure robust code.
The last 7 weeks we team worked to design, implement and ship to production 2 projects.

I am passionate about building innovative solutions that integrate
aesthetic design with functional user interfaces.
